#Hi everyone
Here you'll find my code attempting to get satisfying results in the task of predicting the housing prices in an area. The database was taken from a Kaggle Competition database.
You'ill find two files for the moment:
data_visualisation.ipynb:where i have coded some functions that help understand the data in order to make some relevant feature engineering tasks later and see their impact
housing_pred.ipynb: where i work using various machine learning algorithms and compare their performances
