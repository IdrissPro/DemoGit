#Hi everyone! 

Here you'll find my code attempting to get satisfying results in the task of predicting the housing prices in an area. The database was taken from a Kaggle Competition database.
You'll find four files for the moment:

data_visualisation.ipynb:where i have coded some functions that help understand the data in order to make some relevant feature engineering tasks later and see their impact  

housing_pred.ipynb: where i work using various machine learning algorithms and compare their performances

The data files: train.csv: the training database that will be cut into a train set and a test set
test.csv: the file containing the features of the houses of which we have to predict the price
